# 💪 Confidence Card Generator

🚀 A fun little React project to boost self-confidence — one name and photo at a time!

## ✨ What It Does

This app lets users:

- 📛 Enter their **name**
- 🖼️ Upload a **passport-size photo**
- 🧠 Automatically **validates the image** using `face-api.js` to check if it contains a face
- 🌟 Generates a **Confidence Card** with the name, photo, and a randomly selected motivational quote

It's a beginner-friendly mini-project built to explore how simple UI ideas can turn into interactive apps using React.
